Batch normalization\n","One of the most significant recent ideas that impacted NNs a lot is [**Batch normalization**](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167). The idea is simple, yet effective: the features should be whitened ($mean = 0$, $std = 1$) all the way through NN. This improves the convergence for deep models letting it train them for days but not weeks. **You are** to implement the first part of the layer: features normalization. The second part (`ChannelwiseScaling` layer) is implemented below.\n","\n","- input:   **`batch_size x n_feats`**\n","- output: **`batch_size x n_feats`**\n","\n","The layer should work as follows.
